Using math libraray
Calculate the bearing by first converting the input into radians. Then finding the lattitude by subtracting the current and final position longitude.
x and y are calculated for atan2 to find the quadrent for the angle.  atan2 is calculated and is converted in degrees.
The resulting bearing is checked to start the degress from the North and if not, conversion is done.
